Hey guys, Just finished this. If you ever decided you want to go with MongoDB, this is pretty much the proof-of-concenpt of it working in the C# invironment
To get your environment setup, first you will need to download MongoDB. I used the community version. Next, take a look at the MongoDB Server.txt
to take a look at the commands prompts you need to run to start up the server. The VS environment is pretty much the same and any other .net core app.
all the code is commented and explains how everything works. If you need further assistance, i will include my Bookmarks that i used for this as well.
Been a great summer! Enjoy!
